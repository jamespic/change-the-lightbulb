Crafty Tiled Importer and Crafty both needed some modifications. The modifications to
Crafty Tiled Importer have been submitted back as a pull request. It wasn't practical
to do the same with Crafty, as the Crafty codebase is in the middle of
a refactor. I anticipate that the Crafty refactor, once complete, will make my changes
redundant.
